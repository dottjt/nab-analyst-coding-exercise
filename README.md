## NAB coding challenge

Hello!

My name is Julius. Thank you for looking into my code! I basically spent a few hours hacking it together, I hope you think it's awesome. :grin:

## Structure

Here are the main folders:
  - `src` - UI application source code
  - `public` - UI application static files
  - `server` - server application source code

## Setup

In the root directory run:
  - `npm install` - this will install all the Node.js libraries
  - Please install Node.js onto your machine if you have not already i.e. `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

## Running

To run the application, please enter:
  - `npm start` with relevant arguments

## Future Improvements

- Separate server and client folders with their own `package.json` files and `src` folder structure.
- Write tests
